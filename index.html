        <h3>Monkeys are fascinating primates known for their intelligence, social structures, and playful behaviors.
            They belong to two main groups: New World monkeys, found in the Americas, and Old World monkeys, native to
            Africa and Asia.
        </h3>
        <h3>Monkeys are highly social animals, living in troops that exhibit complex hierarchies. They communicate
            through
            vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions, showcasing their emotional depth. Their diets are
            varied,
            consisting of fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals, highlighting their adaptability in
            different
            environments.
        </h3>
        <h3>Conservation efforts are crucial for many monkey species, as habitat loss and poaching threaten their
            populations. Understanding their behavior and role in ecosystems can help ensure their survival and the
            health
            of their habitats. Monkeys not only captivate our imagination but also remind us of the importance of
            biodiversity in our world.
